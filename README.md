# React Native Dimensions API Inaccuracy on Android

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to obtain screen dimensions, specifically focusing on inconsistencies observed on Android devices. The reported width and height might differ from the actual screen dimensions, leading to layout problems in your application.

## Bug Description
The `Dimensions` API, while generally reliable, can sometimes provide inaccurate screen dimensions, especially on certain Android devices.  This might be attributed to variations in how different Android versions or device manufacturers handle screen measurements.

## Solution
The provided solution showcases a more robust approach to handling screen dimensions. It includes error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure that your application gracefully handles scenarios where the `Dimensions` API yields unreliable results.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project on an Android device or emulator.
3. Observe the logged width and height; they may not precisely reflect the actual screen dimensions.
4. Compare with the output of the solution to see how the issue is resolved.

This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The values returned by `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might not accurately reflect the actual screen size, especially on Android devices. This is often due to device-specific behaviors or inconsistencies in how the OS reports screen dimensions.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage leading to inaccurate dimensions
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('Width:', width, 'Height:', height);
```
